# Hi, I'm Nabiha Nawshin Shukheemoni

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Data Science** student at **Memorial University of Newfoundland**, pursuing a **Minor in Business Administration**. I focus on **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**, combining technical skills with business insights.

## About Me
- 🎯 **Current Focus**: Statistical modeling, ML algorithms, and OOP in Python & R  
- 🎓 **Expected Graduation**: April 2026  
- ✍️ **Hobbies**: Writing stories, exploring AI tools, and using Excel  

## Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, R  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, ggplot2  
- **Tools**: Git, RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, LaTeX, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint  
### 🔹 Completed Projects
- **House Price Prediction (End-to-End ML Pipeline)**  
  Built a fully **production-ready ML pipeline** to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning (XGBoost), cross-validation, and pipeline serialization**.  
  **Skills & Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, RandomizedSearchCV, Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, joblib, RMSE evaluation  
  **Outcome:** Deployed a **leakage-free, tuned ML model** and generated **insights for feature importance and predictions**.
### 🔹 **Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Business-Centric ML)**
Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer attrition. The project focused on **handling class imbalance** (~26% churn rate) and optimizing for **Recall** to minimize revenue loss.
- **Key Techniques:** Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV), Data Leakage Prevention.
- **Skills & Tools:** Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pipelines, Confusion Matrix Analysis, ROC-AUC.
- **Outcome:** Deployed a tuned **XGBoost model** that effectively identifies at-risk customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.
- **Student Spending Analysis**  
  Analyzed student expense patterns using R and visualized trends to identify cost-saving opportunities.  
  **Skills:** Data wrangling, ggplot2 visualizations, statistical analysis  

## Course (Completed) 
- **Google Machine Learning Crash Course**: Learning core ML concepts and TensorFlow basics.  
- **Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning Course (Coursera)**: Studying supervised learning, neural networks, and regularization.  
- **Kaggle Competitions**: Applying data cleaning, model building, and visualization skills.
